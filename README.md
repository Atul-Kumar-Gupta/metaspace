1. Project is Divided in 2 Parts. one is node js (backend) and another is React js (Front end)
2. install node module on both parts separately by npm install. (if there is any issue occuring during node modules installation  then use npm install --force)
3. i have used mongoDB database for storing information.
4. run backend and front end separately by "npm start" command
5. for the backend i have used express framework for fast secure and easy connectivity.
6. for frontend i have used custom css and displayed only few data on screen as confirmed by pratibha.
7. backend is running on port 5000 and front end is running its default port 3000.
